# NNS Governance Working Group

This is an Internet Computer ecosystem working group focused on Network Nervous System (NNS) governance.

## Working Group Process

The end result of the working group will be published documents in this repository that serve as recommendations to the community. The first of these documents is this README, which describes the general operations of the working group.

The basic components of the working group are as follows:

- Subgroups
- Working group meetings
- GitHub Issues
- Pull requests

### Subgroups

A subgroup is a small group of people that work together to achieve a specific outcome for the working group at large. Most of the work of the working group is meant to be done within subgroups.

Subgroups can be self-organized and do not need to wait for working group approval to begin operations.

To create a subgroup, make a GitHub issue prefixed with `Subgroup: `. For example, if you were to create a subgroup focused on researching quadratic voting, the name of the issue could be `Subgroup: Quadratic Voting`. The issue should briefly describe the purpose of the subgroup and list its leaders and other members by GitHub username.

The end results of a subgroup should be documents in this repository. Subgroup members should fork the repository and add their proposed documents as markdown files to their fork. Once ready for general feedback and possible incorporation into the repository, a pull request should be made back into this repository.

### Working group meetings

Here is the [calendar for working group meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19jazBncjc5YmtnY29vaWNuMXA4N21vMWVyb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

The main purpose of working group meetings is to discuss the progress of the current subgroups, propose more subgroups, review current pull requests, and generally manage the affairs of the working group. Currently we are meeting about twice per month.

### GitHub Issues

We will use GitHub issues to track the progress of subgroups and other items that might fall outside of the scope of subgroups. Issues can be opened by anyone. Once an issue is resolved, it should be closed.

### Pull requests

As mentioned before, the end results of subgroups and the main recommendations of the working group will be published in this repository. Before merging any documents into the repository, there should be rough consensus that the document should be incorporated as is.

To make a pull request, first fork this repository. You can then add or change files from GitHub. Once your changes are ready for incorporation back into the main repository, make a pull request. Discussion can then ensue on the pull request itself.
