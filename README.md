# NNS Governance Working Group

This is an Internet Computer ecosystem working group focused on Network Nervous System (NNS) governance.

## Working Group Process

The end result of the working group will be published documents in this repository that serve as recommendations to the community. The first of these documents is this README, which describes the general operations of the working group.

The basic components of the working group are as follows:

- Subgroups
- Working group meetings
- GitHub Issues
- Pull requests

### Subgroups

A subgroup is a small group of people that work together to achieve a specific outcome for the working group at large. Most of the work of the working group is meant to be done within subgroups.

Subgroups can be self-organized and do not need to wait for working group approval to begin operations.

To create a subgroup, make a GitHub issue prefixed with `Subgroup: `. For example, if you were to create a subgroup focused on researching quadratic voting, the name of the issue could be `Subgroup: Quadratic Voting`. The issue should briefly describe the purpose of the subgroup and list its leaders and other members by GitHub username.
